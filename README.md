## 🐞 Troubleshooting
- Dev server not starting: Ensure Node.js 18 or newer is installed and dependencies are installed with npm install or npm ci.
- Port 4200 already in use: Start the server on another port using ng serve --port 4300.
- Unit tests failing unexpectedly: Clear caches (remove node_modules and package-lock.json), then reinstall and rerun tests.
- Documentation not visible: Build TypeDoc locally and serve the docs folder, or visit the hosted docs at https://velizarganchev.github.io/videoflix-frontend/.
- Video player styling issues: Confirm Video.js and any theme styles are correctly included via global styles or Angular.json.
